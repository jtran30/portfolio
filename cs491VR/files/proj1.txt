<h1>Project 1 Discussion </h1><br><br>
<h2>Wand based movement vs. Teleporting</h2><br>
Teleporting in any game can seem unrealistic, and in this case, it really is. In an office setting, teleporting can only mean one thing: good for display. In terms of immersion, at least for this project, it doesn’t seem that it fits. Things that can make teleporting more friendly is the use of particle effects, maybe a teleporting animation of sorts, and a delay in the teleporting to make it more realistic. <br>
Moving via wand feels a lot more better in terms of the current technology we have. It is because we are familiar with playing games (in 3d that is) where using the W,A,S,D keys are used to navigate the player in the 3d world. Well in our case, it’s the wand, which makes up for moving our legs in real life to navigate the game. <br><br>
<h2>Real room vs. the virtual room</h2><br>
The room in the virtual reality seems more like a representation of what it would really look like in real life. It will never appear as such as our room currently. Mainly due to that our room in VR is either too perfect, or not realistic. Such examples are things such as pencils, trashcan, or the ceiling. In the VR, it’s too smooth, or too clean. Compare to our actual room, there is wear and tear, that the ceiling has stains onto it, water damage, or wall scrapings, etc.<br>
My other statement was that the VR room is not realistic. In this case, the textures used were not high enough quality, thus, I see things such as pixels when holding a mug, or a low textured couch when it should be quite the opposite. Obviously when we are playing games, we acknowledge the fact there will be these imperfections in games but in a VR situation like this where gameplay is lacking, details of the textures become more and more prominent.
