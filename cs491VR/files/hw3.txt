Immersion in games is always a spectacle to witness. Starting from Minecraft, we can first witness what it's like to be in an environment that may seem completely foreign to us, but feel as if it were reality as well. This goes from towering mountains, clouds, trees, beasts and structures, where we stand in the shadow of something that is not real - a false reality.<br><br>
Size plays a large role in the act of immersion, and this isn't limited to just video games! It may have happened to any new Chicagoan before. Such a scenario plays out like this: 1) Sleep in the car/train/CTA, then wake up at your stop in downtown. 2) Take a step out of the crowded subway, street/commute. 3) Look up. 4) See towering high-rises in every direction you see, hence the name skyscrapers.<br><br>
This kind of experience can take the breath away from any new tourist or gamer, given the proper environment, but often enough, just sight alone can do the trick. However, like in real life, a good immersion can also be ruined by sight as well.<br><br>

In real life, a beautiful sight of the sky can be ruined by a noisy airplane, or carbon exhaust from a local power plant. In a game, as such as in our examples, we deal with another problem, detail.<br><br>

In a video game, expanded 3d objects will often lose their quality of the texture due to the issue of expanding a sprite. Other side effects include displacement of assets, as things scaled larger may mean that grass or trees are now spread further apart, objects or desks may appear to clip (3d model going through another 3d model) through walls or other objects, or even before any of this can happen - performance issues may arise when objects are scaled too large. Many things can become problematic when designing very large objects that must contain large amount of smaller details. Say, for example, a 3d game requires navigation, and the player cannot fly. If the player cannot fly, then navigating through objects may prove to be problematic.<br><br>
So thus, this brings us to one of my points, immersion. Immersion in 3d visualization means that ties to gameplay are severed; we only care about what we see. So thus, with proper immersion, we can implement 3d visualization via 3d diagrams such as the examples seen in the CAVE2. Additionally, such immersion can be used in games in cut scenes or in the background such as mountains and landscape.<br><br>
